        <h2 id="booking-payments">4) Bookings, Payments & Fees</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When you book a session (“<strong>Run</strong>”), you agree to pay the displayed price, taxes, and any applicable service fees. Payments may be processed by third parties (e.g., Stripe, Apple Pay, Google Pay).</li>
            <li>Some Runs may be free; others may include gym or court fees. Prices are shown before you confirm a booking.</li>
